Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

When I was doing one team activity, I realized that fuctions can 
make breaking down a program with many lines of code simple and 
manageable, I realized that functions can help organize 
a program and improve the readability of your code.

2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions help with making sure that your program works as expected and that
if bugs occure they can be easily handled, test funtions can help detect any problems 
with your code, when written properly.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

My process would be going through the code line by line trying to 
out figure where the problem might be, using the debugging functions.
To improve my process I will also write the try, except, else, and finally
statements to help handle exceptions the best way I can, and that will also help
with figuring out where the problem is.
